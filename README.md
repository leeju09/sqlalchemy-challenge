# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

Skills that are demonstrated:

*Use SQLAlchemy to:
	-Connect to a SQLite database.
	-Reflect database tables into Python classes.
	-Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
	-Query the database to find weather data and filter by the most recent year of 	data and the busiest weather station.
*Use Python to:
	-Load query results into Pandas DataFrames.
	-Create summary statistics using Pandas.
	-Create data visualizations using Matplotlib.
	-Design a Flask application containing both static and dynamic routes based on 	the queries previously developed.

Resources that had helped me complete this challenge are the in class activities and videos, stackoverflow, and learning assistant to complete this assignment.
